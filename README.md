# Max Fan
üëã I love to hack, make, and create! 
I'm a senior at Choate Rosemary Hall (a high school) and president of [Choate Programming Union](https://github.com/ChoateProgrammingUnion), a club that aims to foster a love of programming amongst all students.
I'm also an amateur radio operator ([general class](http://www.arrl.org/ham-radio-licenses)) ‚Äì my callsign is KC1LTV. 
I mainly focus on crypto/security related things, although I have a variety of other interests.

Here are several of my more interesting recent open-source projects (in no particular order):
### üîë Cryptography and Security
- **[dropbox-timestamp](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/dropbox-timestamp):** Automatic and trustless cryptographic timestamping in Dropbox (with attestations uploaded to Bitcoin) 

- **[pylamport](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/pylamport):** A python library for generating cryptographic Lamport signatures

- **[homomorphic-encryption](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/homomorphic-encryption):** Basic algebraic operators encrypted with LWE utilizing GPU acceleration and ripple adders 

- **[constant-time-benchmark](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/constant-time-benchmark):** Benchmarking various supposedly constant time algorithms to validate various cryptographic implementations against side-channel attacks in Golang

- **[Secure Secret Santa](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/SSS):** Secure Secret Santa (flavored with a medley cryptographic security proofs and anonymity-preserving properties) 

- **[Trustless Random Beacon](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/random-tournament-beacon):** A secure randomness beacon using the Bitcoin blockchain, repeatedly applied hashes, and opentimestamps.
> This was used to generate demonstrably random pairings of a chess tournament to great success! 

- **[monobox](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/monobox):** A flexible, simple, (and secure) tool for rapidly coding, testing, and deploying applications using Docker 

- **[CTFtools](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/CTFtools):** Tools for cybersecurity (CTF) competitions 

- **[timestamp-api](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/timestamp-api):** A HTTP api for timestamping via opentimestamps (with attestations on the Bitcoin blockchain) 

- **[securechecks](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/securechecks):** Security tools to lock down and prevent pwnage


### ‚öôÔ∏è Theory of Computation

- **[pylambda](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/pylambda):** A Turing complete, experimental prototype programming language based off lambda calculus in Python 

> This project was a weekend project ‚Äì I plan to revisit this soon and add some types!

- **[proppy](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/Proppy):** A simple python propositional logic checker and solver (work in progress)

### üìñ Machine Learning
- **[chesscompress](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/chesscompress):** Working towards state-of-the-art chess move compression (~90% compression)

- **[deeppacket](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/deeppacket):** GAN to fool deep packent inspection (DPI) and circumvent censorship

- **[TrumpTweets](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/TrumpTweet):** Machine generated Trump-like tweets 


### üóÑÔ∏è Archive Team
I also have spent some time helping out [Archive Team](https://www.archiveteam.org/) by writing software that smartly queues some archiving jobs onto ~100 servers through an IRC interface.

- **[queuebot](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/queuebot):** A smart autoscaling queueing service for archivebot for eventual upload to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (WBM). Currently focusing on automatic archival of missing political and governmental twitter accounts. Live on efnet/#archivebot. 

- **[archivist](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/archivist):**  Archiving politically and culturally important social media with archiveteam and archivebot (on IRC) to IA's WBM. Currently live on efnet/#archivebot. 

### ‚ûï Misc
- **[Choate Zoom Coordinator](https://github.com/ChoateProgrammingUnion/zoom-coordinator):** A unified location for attending classes on Zoom. Currently in production to ~ 1000 people.

- **[mongoset](https://github.com/TadpoleTutoring/mongoset):** A super-Pythonic way to interact with MongoDB with good defaults. Drop in replacement for [dataset](https://github.com/pudo/dataset).

# üß∞ Tooling
*I place a great emphasis on my tooling ‚Äì¬†my belief is that the more familiar I am with my tools, the better I am equipped to solve the problems I want to solve.*

I usually write code in [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) (basically emacs + vim) or [Vim (neovim)](https://neovim.io/) and spend most of my time in terminal ([iTerm2]()). My dotfiles (somewhat up to date) are [here](https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/dotfiles). 
I usually use [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) over [mosh](https://mosh.org/) to remotely work and develop, but sometimes I use good old-fashioned ssh. 
For IRC, I use [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) with several custom plugins and filters (may be open-sourced soon) and my nick is usually `maxfan8` (you can find me on [efnet](http://www.efnet.org/) and [hackint](https://hackint.org/), although I prefer the latter).
