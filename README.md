I love to hack, make, and create! 
I'm currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
I'm also a ham radio operator ([general class](http://www.arrl.org/ham-radio-licenses)) â€“ my callsign is `KC1LTV`. 

My main interests are as follows (in order of most recent/level of interest):
- type theory, theorem proving, and formal verification (under [Professor Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/))
- [computational redistricting](https://mggg.org/) (quantifying gerrymandering via [math](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/1ds8ptxu) and [code](https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain))
- reverse engineering
- cryptography

I also dabble in other things as well :).
